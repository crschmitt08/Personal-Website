Hello, Everyone!

I enjoy analyzing data and creating reports to answer business related questions. Currently, I work as a Financial Analyst at [1st Financial Federal Credit Union](https://www.1stfinancialfcu.org/), where I perform various types of analysis to answer questions from leadership and build reports to dissiminate information to key stakeholders. The primary tools I use include: SQL, Excel, R, and DeepSee.

I graduated from the [University of North Dakota](https://und.edu/programs/applied-economics-ms/index.html) with a MS in Applied Economics in 2017. Here I gained hands-on experience in economic theory, mathematical economics, and advanced statistical methods. For my thesis, I studied the effects of changes to compulsory school attendance and the returns to schooling. I replicated a paper written by Melvin Stephen Jr. and Dou-Yan Yang and added an extension to their work. My extension attempted to rescue their model by sorting out the defiers and always takers from the compliers includes in the data. For more information, you can read a copy of thesis [here](Thesis.pdf). There was no attempt to publish this paper.

Since graduating, data science has become a hobby of mine. Over the last year or so, I completed the Data Scientist career track on [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/), along with several other courses and projects on their website. I created a Shiny dashboard to display member and product trends over time at my place of work. A personal project I am working is loan default prediction model and Shiny app to showcase how we could better utilize the free tools at our disposal.
